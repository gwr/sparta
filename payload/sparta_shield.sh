# Version       : 0.05
# Usage         : sparta_shield.sh
# Purpose       : A Watchdog script to monitor the SPARTA performance logging 
#		  filesystem and stop sparta.sh if that becomes too full
# Legal         : Copyright 2013, Nexenta Systems, Inc. 
#
# History       : 0.01 - Initial version
#		  0.02 - Moved the date prefix code so it's accurate when we
#		         need to record this in the sparta.log file
#		  0.03 - Modified how we call the stop method to SPARTA
#		  0.04 - Added a trap handler to shutdown SPARTA and exit the shield
#		  0.05 - Improved logic for shutdown code
